# dynamic_gutenberg_block
I want to create a custom gutenberg block with image(s), title, subtitle, desription and links.

Something like this: https://codepen.io/whatthephuc/pen/ydMQzj?editors=1100

The problem with Gutenberg is, that if you change something in the "save" function, the block will be deprecated. 
Description of the problem can be found here: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4849#issuecomment-503773022
